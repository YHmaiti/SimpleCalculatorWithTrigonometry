# SimpleCalculatorWithTrigonometry


=> This program was made by Yohan Hmaiti
# GitHub: YHmaiti

# This program represents a calcuator in Julia

# This program provides basic operations such as: addition, substraction, division and multiplication
# of any expression entered by the user as long as it follows the set instructions.
# This program also offers a trigonometry based calculator with sin, cos, tan calculations along with their
# inverses.

# This program was made to advance learning of the Julia programming language and multiple of its 
# commands, functions and syntax

# This program uses the sleep function along with the CalculusWithJulia and Match packets
# This program requires having the Trigonometry.jl file in the same local folder

****** Additional Information: ******

=> Note: Check the Calculator.jl file for additional information as this file represents 
         just one part of the calcuator

# use packages to simplify access to trigonometric unctionalities 
# and the match function

using CalculusWithJulia
using Match
